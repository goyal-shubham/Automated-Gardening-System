# Automated-Gardening-System

Designed and implemented an Automated gardening system as a part of academic project Object Oriented Analysis and Desgin.

Description:
Analyze, design, and implement an automated gardening system. You will only need to turn in your Java implementation and user guide/manual. However, if you do not
analyze the requirements and design your system prior to starting your implementation you will fail and receive a very low score!

Some requirements:


• You must have a user interface. It does not need to be a graphical one but a graphical user interface will help with usability and thus make your TAs
very happy! The happier your TAs are during grading the better your chances are for getting a higher grade!!! Poor UI designs will lose a lot of
points!

• You must have several Modules. An implementation that does not include various standalone modules will not receive a good grade! Some module
examples are: watering system, heating system, UI, log keeping, etc. 

• Your garden must be a big garden with many sprinklers, heaters, sensors, plants of various kind, insects, etc.

• You must account for the passage of time. Meaning:
o model every day as 24 minutes
o sprinklers, heaters, etc. need to turn on and off as scheduled or as needed due to circumstances
o plants grow and thus need more water, fertilizer, heat, etc. as the program progresses

• You must implement some randomness into your system. For example, it rains and so you should not turn on the sprinklers that day;
or it gets really cold one night and you will need to turn on the heater even though it is during a warm time of the year; or maybe 
your garden is attacked by a pest and needs pesticides. Ensure at minimum 5 different types of random situations that could occur. 
The number of times or when each occurs should be random.

• You must implement manual overrides for a human gardener. Meaning the system must allow user interactions and interventions with the growing
plan. The user should be able to update the plan as need be and the system should give the user appropriate warnings when decisions alter the plan.
• Your system must keep a detailed log of every occurrence, interaction, etc. as well as the progress of your growing plan and state of the garden/plants.
We will run your program for a whole day (roughly equivalent to a whole month for your garden) and then read through the logs. If the logs are poor
in quality and hard to navigate then even though your program may be working correctly, since we won’t be able to determine that, we will
assume that it does not work properly and thus you will lose significant amounts of points. You will not get a chance to remedy this by explaining
your log or program.
